# Housing in Mexico - Exploratory Data Analysis and Price Influences

## Overview

This project involves analyzing housing data in Mexico to uncover key factors influencing property prices. Using a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization techniques, and statistical insights, the goal is to identify trends and attributes that affect housing costs. The project is structured in Jupyter notebooks for easy iteration and data exploration.

## Project Motivation
Housing affordability is a crucial issue in many parts of the world, including Mexico. This project aims to analyze housing market data to identify significant patterns and relationships between prices and various factors, such as location, amenities, and more.

## Project Structure

- **`a_housing_in_mexico.ipynb`**: Contains the main analysis of housing data in Mexico, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA.
- **`Exploitary_Data_analysis.ipynb`**: Focuses on performing exploratory data analysis with a deeper dive into specific variables and their impacts.
- **`influences_of_prices.ipynb`**: Analyzes various price drivers and factors that influence housing prices across different regions.

## Data Source

The data used for this project includes housing price listings, locations, and additional property features. (Specify the source if publicly available.)

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebooks** for data analysis
- **Python** for scripting and data manipulation
- **Pandas** for handling datasets
